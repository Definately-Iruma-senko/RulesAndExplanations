    <h1>Quick Game Explanation :</h1>
    
    <font color="#e82113">
    <p>Players will be drafted onto teams based on how good they are. There will be a mix of all skill levels on all teams.</p>
    <p>Teams will have 5 players with substitutes, and will face off against each other in a tournament</p>
    <p>It will be up to the team that can create the best strategies and utilize the strengths of their teammates to win this 1v1 team event.</p></font>
    
        <h3>Drafting and Team Creation <font color=blue>(Helpful Info)</font></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player who wishes to participate in this tournament will fill out a google form. This google form will ask each player how good they think they are, from 1-5, how well they work with teammates, from 1-5, as well as questions to determine what dates and times for games work for them.
            </li><br>
            <li>Once this information is gathered, a player expert will review the applications and determine the player score that each player will receive, from 1-5. Taxin has already volunteered to do this, but more people are needed. DM Tempest for more information</li><br>
            <li>The player scores will be entered into an algorithm to get 5 players per team, with a total score of 18-20 points. Players whose times do not match up with the majority, as well as players who do not intend to be as committed will be assigned to teams as substitutes. A team may have as little as 1 substitute, or as many as 3</li><br>
            <li>The player with the highest score will be made the team captain. In future seasons, the team captain will be able to remove players from their team and draft new players.</li><br>
            <li>Teams will be split into different group chats, or sections in a server, where they will be able to talk to/voice chat with each other. Teams will come up with their own (appropriate) team name!</li><br>
        </ul>
        <h3> Dates, Times, and Under-Representation/Over-Representation <font color=blue>(Necessary)</font></h3>
        <ul><li>Dates and Times will be determined through a google form</li></ul>
    <p>Under/Over Representation example: Let’s say Team A has only 4 members able to compete, including substitutes. Team B has all 5 members ready to compete.</p>
    
    <font color=darkblue><p>Team B has a choice. They can either:
        1- Not play one of their members (Any member), making the game more fair. 
        2- Play with all 5 members, despite the fact they will have a large advantage.
        </p>
        <p>If you do not have enough players to play, you should reach out to a head organizer, who may be able to secure a free agent for you. When doing this, make sure to clearly state which member/members are missing, and their discord ids.</p>
        <p>Substitution will only be made before the event. When substituting, make sure to DM Tempest <b>who will not be playing, and who will be playing instead.</b> </p></font>
        <h3>Tournament Stages and Points <font color=blue>(Helpful Info)</font></h3>
        <ul><li>The first stage of the tournament will be a group stage. There will be as many groups as possible (Probably 2), of 3 teams each. A win grants a team 2 points, a tie 1, and a loss 0.
        </li>
        <br><li>Each team will play each other team in the group once.</li><br>
        <li>The top two teams in the group will move on, and in the case of a tie, there will be a vote by the judges for who advances / a match between the two teams that tied</li><br>
        <li>The winners of the group stage will advance to the elimination stage, where if they lose, they are out of the tournament</li><br>
        <li>The final two teams will compete in several matches (best of 5). The winner wins the tournament.</li><br>
        <h3>Playing rules and Ship Builds <font color=blue>(Necessary)</font></h3></ul>
        <ul><li>
            Deliberate feeding, or gem mining of the enemy team is not allowed, and the offender/offenders will be removed from the game. If it is found that this is an act by a team to gain an advantage, that team will be REMOVED from the tournament.
            </li><br>
            <li>There are many ways of cheating to gain an advantage through the other team. If this is found, teams/offenders will be permanently removed from the tournament, including future ones. </li><br>
            <li>You <b>may</b> say “offensive” things to other teams through emotes. Taunting and emotional-play is part of the game! </li><br>
            <li>As for ship builds, in order to make the games fun for viewers to watch, no more than 2 scorpions/advanced fighters can be created.</li><br>
            <li>Finally, there can <b>only be 1 healer per team</b></li><br>
            <b>Violations of this will result in a match loss! Team Captains: Make sure all your players know not to cheat (intentionally or unintentionally), or violate ship builds!  If you have any questions on either, make sure to ask an organizer or head organizer for clarity</b>
            <h2>Joining the Match <font color=blue>(Necessary)</font></h2></ul>
            <ul><li>The link to the official game will be sent into a <b>private discord section</b> of the two teams playing.</li><br>
            <li><b>Sharing this link will result in a match loss for the player/team involved.</b></li><br>
        <li>It will be specified what color each team will join</li><br>
        <li>If a member accidentally joins the wrong color, nothing will happen unless they stay on that team for over 15 seconds</li><br>
        <li>If they do, the match will be restarted and/or the player may be kicked, and/or there may be a match loss for the offending team, depending on the situation.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h2>Observing the Game and Youtube/Streaming <font color=red>(Helpful Info)</font></h2>
    <ul><li>There will be 4 observers, one of them being a rules expert (who is also the game host), who will record the match, and talk to a head organizer during the match if a rule was broken to assess the next move.</li><br>
    <li> There will also be three other recording observers. One of them will record the match’s main plays, and attempt to follow the action as best as they can. Another will catch secondary action, like base income and mining patterns.</li><br>
<li>The other will be the commentator/commentators. One of them (if applicable) will navigate the observer and both (if applicable) will comment on the game. Head Organizer and Founder “Tempest” will likely be one of those commentators.</li></ul><br>
<font face="Arial Narrow"><h2>MVP of the league <font color=red>(Helpful Info)</font></h2>
<ul><li>5 league-selected judges will pick the most valuable player of the tournament., taking input from a vote. It does not matter how well the team does for this, only how well the player does.</li>
<br>
<li>This MVP may get a sUCP, as well as a special role and shoutout.</li><br>
<li>There will also be most valuable players for different positions, such as healing, support, attack, defense, mining, control, and zoning, determined by Tempest and advisors. They will all get a role and shoutout.<br></li></ul>
<font face="Arial black"><b>Note: sUCPs are not guaranteed. </b></font><br><br>
<font face="Arial Narrow"><h2>Prizes and Donations <font color=red>(Helpful Info)</font></h2>
<ul><li>There will be prizes for first, second, and third in the tournament!</li><br>
<li>The first place team may get custom player-team combo sUCPs, and guaranteed 15 dollars for all of their starters. They will also get a shoutout, and an exclusive role. Each player will get a role based on what they did to contribute to their team's victory, such as “The Tank,” or “Odyssey Sniper.”</li><br><li>2nd place may earn a sUCP for their Captain, a shoutout, an  exclusive role, and 7 dollars for each of their starters.</li><br>
<li>Third place will earn a sUCP for their Captain, a shoutout, a (slightly worse) custom role and 5 dollars for each of their starters.</li><br>
<li>Each team may get less or more money, depending on donations. The way for you to donate is yet to be decided.</li><br>
<b>Note: sUCPs and Prize Money are not guaranteed.</b></ul>
<font face="Arial Narrow"><h2>Judging, Rules Expert, Commentator, Organizer and Voting <font color=red>(Helpful Info)</font></h2><br><br>
<ul><li>There will be multiple opportunities to have a say in the competition, even if you are not participating in the games. You will be tested for neutrality, and can not be affiliated with any teams if you want to be a judge. DM a head organizer to apply for the position.</li><br><li>If you want to be a rules expert, memorize these rules (if you find any flaws point them out), and DM “Tempest” to start your test (google form). If your knowledge is satisfactory, you will be made a rules expert, and may be deployed in a game. If you find any violations in the rules in a game, you will let a head organizer know, and show them a clip of the violation so that appropriate action can proceed.</li><br><li>If you want to be a commentator, you have to DM a Head Organizer a clip of you reacting to a starblast.io game, (even if the screen is being controlled by an actual ship). This is meant to test your knowledge of game strategies and advantages.</li><br><li>If you want to be an organizer, a form will be created and posted.</li><br><li>As for voting, there will be several positions that will be voted on, such as MVP, and best team chemistry, which will require the average server member to vote.</li><br><li>You may be fired from any position for multiple reasons, (which are not limited to the following) such as showing bias, not performing to standard (if you are unsure of what is satisfactory or not, it is your responsibility to clarify with a head organizer), or not respecting the judgment or authority of a superior.</li><br><li>If you are fired, it will likely only be for a season, but certain actions, such as helping a team get an advantage, may result in a 2 season ban, or a permanent ban.</li><br></ul></font></font></font><font face=Arial Narrow color="blue"><b>Note: Roles such as Judge, Rules Expert, Commentator, and Organizer will generally stop you from playing for a team. There may be exceptions. If you want to do both, DM a head organizer.</b></font><p><font face="arial black">Questions: If you have any questions, feel free to ask an organizer or head organizer, and if you are still confused, feel free to ping me (Tempest). I don’t mind pings.</p></font><font face="Arial Narrow"><b> New rules may be added any time, including when the season begins in response to game events.</b></font>
